# SpotifyClone
For my final project for Boolean, I created clone to Spotify with lyrics showcasing of the song selected. This application was made from HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, BOOTSTRAP. It consisted of Authorization code flow through several API including: Spotify. 

When running the live server for the app, you'll be shown log with SpotifyZZ page, then it will lead you to spotify cloned page. With search bar on the top. If you search for a song or artsit then select it. It will play on the player at the bottom and lyrics of the song will shown to you in  the middle of the page.

This wasn't my orignal idea, my original idea was to to still use spotify api, but to return Users top tracks for month, 6 months and all-time, however that idea was archived. For this idea awhich allowed to keep the lot of orignal code to be used. Future additions, wil be to include more welcoming login page and abilty to search for playlists as well. 

The authorisation flow was the most hardest in getting right for this, and learning bootstrap to apply to this applciation.
